# CreTech
This project is part of the CreTech portfolio, a collection of diverse projects showcasing various development skills and approaches to building different types of applications.

# Project 1:
## Simple Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot built using Python and spaCy for natural language processing. The chatbot can respond to greetings, questions, and other simple inputs using predefined responses. It was developed as part of an internship project to demonstrate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Predefined Responses**: Responds to greetings, questions, and other simple inputs.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses spaCy to process and understand user input.
- **Interactive Chat**: Provides a conversational experience with predefined intents like greetings, jokes, and more.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **NLP Library:** spaCy

## Future Enhancements

This project is continuously being developed. Some planned future features include:

* **Enhanced NLP:** Implement more advanced NLP techniques for better understanding and response generation.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Improve the chatbot's ability to maintain context and remember previous interactions.
* **Expanded Communication Channels:** Integrate with other messaging platforms.
* **User Interface Improvements:** Enhance the user interface for a more engaging experience.
* **Additional Features:** Consider adding features like message editing, deletion, and search.

# Project 2:
## Game Development (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python and the Pygame library.  It features a graphical interface, two-player mode, and a player-versus-computer mode with a simple AI.

## Features

* **Player vs Player Mode:** Supports classic two-player gameplay.
* **Scorecard:** Tracks and displays the score for each player.
* **Graphical Interface:** Uses Pygame for a user-friendly experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Game board adapts to the window size.
* **Enhanced Visuals:** Bold X and O symbols, and a colored background.
* **Game Over Screen:** Displays the winner or a draw message with a "Play Again" button.

## How to Run the Game

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

2.  **Installation:**
    * Clone this repository to your local machine.
    * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3.  **Run the Game**

## Game Controls

* Click on an empty cell in the game board to make your move.
* In Player vs Computer mode, the computer will make its move automatically after you.
* After the game ends (win or draw), a "Play Again" button will appear.  Click it to start a new game.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement a more sophisticated AI (e.g., minimax algorithm).
* Add options for different board sizes.
* Implement a settings menu for customizing the game.
* Add sound effects and animations.
